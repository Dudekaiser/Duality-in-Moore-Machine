# Duality-in-Moore-Machine

It is already known that there are two representative types of FSM (Finite State Machine). The first is Mealy machine, whose output depends on the current state and input. Mostly, Mealy machine is used for minimizing the number of states.  And the second is Moore machine, whose output depends only on the current state. This research focuses on duality of the Moore machine. To be more precise, we use L* algorithm with learnlib to learn reversed automaton. Then we can compare in perspective of runtime, the number of Membership-queires and Equivalence-queries in order to know which one between original and reversed automaton is better.
